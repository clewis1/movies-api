# movies-api

This is the api layer for the movies application.
To start the application, open the pom.xml file in Intellij (or any suitable IDE).
Next run "MovieWebApplication" and ensure the web layer is also running (See movies-web README.md for more details).

When both layers are up and running, head to http://localhost:8080/ to begin using the application.
Note: web port number set at default. Please check your port number at application start up.

Api port is set at 8079.
